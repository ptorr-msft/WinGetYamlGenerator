# WinGetYamlGenerator

## Note that this project is currently on-hold (and has been removed from the Store).
This was due to the schema changes in `winget` and the fact that there's now a built-in `winget-create` mechanism to create YAML files.
If there's interest, I can update this project to work with the new schema...

## About

Simple GUI editor for creating YAML files for Windows Package Manager. Very bare-bones, but it does the job to get you started.

The app is also available in [the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-package-manager-yaml-generator/9p3n60fs22k5).

## Why the birthday cake logo?
Because when winget was announced to our team (internally), someone said "I don't want to write YAML; can you make it easy?" and it also happened to be that person's birthday. So as a joke I made them a birthday present. 

Then someone said "you should publish this" so here we are.
